# Argo Tunnel Docker

Dead simple docker-compose template for fronting one or more servers with argo tunnels.

Create a docker network called `tunnel` with `docker network create tunnel` or choose any name you like and update the docker-compose.

Can be used on its own with existing docker or host containers or as part of a larger docker-compose project

Checkout branches [x86_64](https://github.com/mtheos/argo-tunnel-docker/tree/x86_64) and [arm](https://github.com/mtheos/argo-tunnel-docker/tree/arm) for respective docker-compose files
